This is a simple music widget for Android, which you can add to your home screen, to listen to the music stored in your device

While it's playing music, it will show you the name of the song/artist in the widget itself and in a notification, which also shows up on your lock screen.


Touch the headphone icon to find and select the song you want to play.

The widget and its notification have play/pause/stop/previous/next buttons to control what you are playing.

The first button in the widget lets you enable or disable the random playback order.

**Note**: This app will not create a new shortcut in your application drawer. You simply need to add the widget to your home screen.
